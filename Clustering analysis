#Let's compare anomalously dim candidates with bright controls. Both of these subsets should have a distance bias, given that we control for the expected absolute residuals of the model, and those residuals are distance-dependent. Let's start by checking summary statistics of each of the subsets.

#The bright controls are only slightly farther away, by ~5% in average.

#We will now concatenate the position frames of the candidates and bright controls.
